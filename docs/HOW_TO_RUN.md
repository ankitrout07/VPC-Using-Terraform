# How to Run — Fortress VNet

## Before You Start

Make sure you have these installed:

```bash
terraform --version   # needs to be >= 1.0
az --version          # Azure CLI
kubectl version       # Kubernetes CLI
node --version        # Node.js (for dashboard backend)
ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  # SSH key
```

No SSH key? Run this:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
Just hit Enter for all prompts.

---

## Step 1 — Login to Azure

```bash
az login
```

A browser window opens. Sign in. Come back to the terminal.

---

---

## Step 2 — Deploy the Infrastructure

The project is now configured to be **totally non-interactive**. All resource names are randomised automatically.

```bash
cd networking
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This will:
1. Create a single, shared Resource Group for all components (VNet, AKS, DB, Redis, Bastion, and State Storage).
2. Build and push your custom dashboard to ACR.
3. Deploy the application to AKS.

This takes about **10–15 minutes** (AKS and Application Gateway deployment).

---

## Step 3 — Access the Dashboard

- **Dashboard URL**: `http://<app_gateway_public_ip>`
- **Backend Health**: All replicas are "Ready" and joined to the Application Gateway's backend pool.

---

## Step 4 — Verify the Cluster and Gateway

When it finishes you'll see something like:
```
aks_cluster_name      = "Fortress-VNet-aks"
app_gateway_public_ip = "<app_gateway_public_ip>"
acr_login_server      = "fortressvnetacrxxxx.azurecr.io"
```

### Accessing the Web App
Once you've deployed an ingress/service to AKS, you can reach it via:
```
http://<app_gateway_public_ip>
```
Note: It may take **5 minutes** for the Application Gateway to finish its initial provisioning.

---

## Authenticate to ACR
```bash
az acr login --name <acr_name>
```

---

## Connect to the Database

From an app VM (inside the VNet):
```bash
psql -h <db_server_fqdn> -U adminuser -d fortressdb
```

---

## Step 5 — Deploying the Custom Dashboard

Since we've replaced the default Nginx page with a custom dashboard, you need to build and push the image to ACR:

**1. Build the Docker Image:**
```bash
cd dashboard
docker build -t <acr_login_server>/fortress-dashboard:v2 .
```

**2. Push to ACR:**
```bash
# Ensure you are logged in (from Step 4)
docker push <acr_login_server>/fortress-dashboard:v2
```

**3. Apply to Kubernetes:**
```bash
cd ../k8s
kubectl apply -f fortress-app.yaml
kubectl apply -f fortress-ingress.yaml
```

**4. Access the Dashboard:**
Open your browser and navigate to the `app_gateway_public_ip` (from Step 4 output).

---

## Step 6 — Verify Real-Time WebSocket Updates

Once the dashboard is running, you can verify the real-time pod monitoring:

**1. Open the Dashboard** in your browser → go to the **Cluster Nodes** tab.

**2. Watch pods appear** — the Pod Counter card on the Overview tab shows the current count.

**3. Trigger Autoscaling with ApacheBench:**
```bash
ab -n 20000 -c 200 http://<APP_GATEWAY_IP>/
```

**4. What You'll See:**

| Phase | Pod Counter | Tag | Terminal Log |
|-------|-------------|-----|--------------|
| Before load | 2 | `STABLE` | — |
| During load | 2 → 4 → 8+ | `SCALING UP` (pulsing) | `HPA Triggered: Scaling from 2 → 8 pods` |
| After load | Scales back down | `SCALING DOWN` | `Workload decreased: Scaling down to 2 pods` |

The dashboard updates every **2 seconds** via WebSocket — no page refresh needed.

## Windows Users 🪟

This project uses a `Makefile` and bash-style commands which do not run natively in CMD or PowerShell.

**Recommended Options:**
1.  **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: Install Ubuntu via WSL and run all commands there. This is the most reliable way.
2.  **Git Bash**: You can run the `terraform` and `az` commands in Git Bash, but the `Makefile` may still fail without a version of `make` installed.
3.  **PowerShell**: You can run Terraform manually, but you will need to replace bash variables (like `$(...)`) with PowerShell syntax.

---

## Teardown — Delete Everything

```bash
cd networking
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

---

## Common Issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `No subscription found` | Run `az login` again |
| `ssh-key not found` | Run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` |
| Gateway error 502/404 | Initial provisioning can take up to 10 minutes |
| `kubectl` not connecting | Ensure you are connected to the VNet (private cluster) |
| `Backend config changed` | Run `rm -rf .terraform` then `terraform init` again |

---

## Setting Up CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

To make GitHub automatically deploy on every merge:

**1. Create an Azure Service Principal:**
```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "fortress-vnet-github" \
  --role Contributor \
  --scopes /subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>
```

**2. Add these 5 secrets to GitHub** → Settings → Secrets → Actions:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | `clientId` from above |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `clientSecret` from above |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Your subscription ID |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | `tenantId` from above |
| `TF_DB_PASSWORD` | Your DB password |

**3. Uncomment the backend block** in `networking/provider.tf` and fill in your storage account name.

**4. Push to GitHub** — the workflow runs automatically.
